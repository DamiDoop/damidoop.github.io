                <p>Welcome to my website, DamiDoop.XYZ! This website will be where I write blog posts about whatever it
                may be that I want to get out of my head, I'll have pages for all the projects I'm working on, and really
                just about anything else I want to put on this website.</p>
                <p>Luckily for all, this website is fairly easy to navigate! Either to the left or just above, you'll
                see the navigation window. You can click on most of the options, while some are just dropdowns. Keep in
                mind that all the pages under "Archives" and "Services" will all open external sites in this tab.</p>
