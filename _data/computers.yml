- name: HP ProBook 650 G2
  desc: I use this one as a jack of all trades, as it runs Windows 11, ChromeOS, Fedora Linux, and macOS Monterey. It
      has come in handy more than a few times, especially as I don't own any modern Macs. I got this laptop late 2024 from
      a family member, and I've definitely made sure to put it to good use.

- name: HP ProBook 650 G2
  desc: This one is a replacement for the late 450 G3, so it will likely just end up becoming a pi-hole, or maybe I'll
    try proxmox again with it. As with the other 650 G2, this laptop was also given in late 2024 from that family member.

- name: Lenovo Thinkpad T480
  desc: My T480. I got it for school after my Surface Laptop Go failed on me, and it has been rock solid since. I know
    that it is an aging laptop, but it still runs absolutely flawlessly on linux. I was previously running Fedora 41 on
    it, though I switched to Universal Blue's Aurora 41 because I wanted to try out an immutable distribution. Despite
    having the T480 for less time than some of the other computers, it has gone on quite the journey! It's been from my
    home in southwestern Ontario all the way to the west coast in Vancouver, and it's got the stickers to prove it!

- name: HP ProBook 6570b
  desc: I got this laptop back in 2018 from that aforementioned family member, and it served me well through school,
    until it got too old and I just wasn't tech-savvy enough to help it. It went out of commission for a while, until
    about late 2023 when my Surface died. Since then, this laptop got me through computer science classes, and I've even
    fallen directly onto it while going to school. I expect this ProBook to live longer than the others I own. This
    ProBook runs both Windows 8.1 and Gentoo Linux.

- name: Mac Mini 2,1 (Mid-2007)
  desc: I just got this computer (as of writing this) for $20 on FB Marketplace, and it's my first ever Mac. It is running
    Mac OS X 10.6.8 Snow Leopard and has been pretty fun to mess with. It doesn't run OSX slowly, but it certainly runs
    Debian 12 rather slowly. I also gotta say, I do like how the Mac Minis look.

- name: Main Desktop
  desc: I built this desktop back in April of 2020, and it has served me well ever since. It started with Windows 10, but
    has followed me on my Linux journey through Pop!_OS, Manjaro, and it's final distro for the past several years, Arch
    Linux.

- name: My Server
  desc: Using a motherboard and SSD I got in 2023, I used my desktop's old CPU to build a server that was an upgrade from
    the last components. I have Ubuntu Server 24.04.1 installed and it has been running plenty of services since I made it,
    and I don't know what I'd use if not those services.

- name: XP/7 Machine
  desc: This was my old server, which at the time lacked a GPU. Currently, I use it for Windows XP and Windows 7 as the
    early 2010s hardware has good driver support for both. It's come in handy for CD ripping and burning.
