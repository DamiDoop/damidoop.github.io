                <p>The NCX Programming website was essentially relegated off to me to maintain because the others didn't
                    really want to work on it as it did work beforehand. Prior to deciding to test out my then
                    new-found HTML and CSS knowledge to make the website more visually appealing, the site looks rather bland
                    and boring, and the blog page was *not* looking that great. I'm fairly proud of my work on it, and I suggest
                    you go check it out at <a href="https://ncxprogramming.com">ncxprogramming.com</a>!</p>
                <p>I did write a blog post on my work on the site, which can be read over on the NCX site directly, or
                    <a href="/2024/08/16/site-facelift">here</a> on this site!</p>
