So I just bought Webfishing last night, a purchase that I had been holding off because of
- a. I didn't know if I was willing to spend those seven dollars and
- b. wasn't sure just how much I would actually want to play.

I started the game fully expecting to be requesting a refund by an hour later, but that didn't happen. I played for an
hour and then was sad when it was 01:00 and time to go to sleep. This game is just so easy to pick up and put down that
it's kinda insane, like today I installed it on my Laptop, copied over my save files and just played in class when I had
nothing else to do and just could play.

In my less than one day of ownership, I already have about 8 hours of playtime under my belt from playing both last
night, at school, and a few hours after school. I already have a few gripes with the game that I'm sure will be worked
out at some point in the future.

My first issue is that the save files don't sync automatically, whether it be with Steam Cloud or something else. This
had already been an issue earlier today when I was trying to copy my save from my laptop back to my desktop. In Dolphin,
I had a split view open, one side with my local Webfishing compatdata folder, and the other side had the same folder just
on my laptop through SFTP. When I was copying the files over, I needed to delete the existing files on my desktop. 
However, I didn’t realise that the files on either side were both selected, and I ended up deleting all the progress I
had made up to that point. It was quite annoying, though not the end of the world as I swiftly made that progress back
today.

My solution currently is to use my Nextcloud to sync the folder together, though I'm not sure if Nextcloud is really the
best option for me here. I know people use SyncThing, but I don't know how to set it up right now, so I'll have to look
at all the different solutions.

The other issue that I noticed about the game is that it is not compatible with controllers. Now, as someone who
primarily uses either a desktop or a laptop, this really isn't a big deal for me. However, I also have a Steam Deck that
I would absolutely love to be able to play Webfishing on. I know that people have made custom layouts for the game, but
I also have heard that none of them are that great in particular.

Other than those two issues, I’ve loved my (as of now) little time playing this silly little furry fishing game. I've
been taking screenshots of all the fun fish catch quotes that I've seen, or some other fun or silly things I've seen in
the game.

As usual, thanks for taking the time out of your day to read my blog post, and hopefully you'll come back for the next!
(whenever that may be lol)
